# ZhuaTech Security Information and Event Management

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for enterprise security, identity, compliance, and risk governance.

ZhuaTech Security Information and Event Management provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for enterprise security, identity, compliance, and risk governance. It is designed for security, risk, compliance, audit, and platform operations teams, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise security information and event management, self-hosted security information and event management, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Solution Overview

- **Primary users:** Security, risk, compliance, audit, and platform operations teams.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Business Coverage

- **Asset and control inventory** — Manage asset and control inventory with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Policy and access governance** — Coordinate policy and access governance through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Detection and assessment workflows** — Track detection and assessment workflows metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Risk-based approval gates** — Preserve risk-based approval gates evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Remediation tracking and evidence** — Expose remediation tracking and evidence in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Security metrics and audit reporting** — Connect security metrics and audit reporting to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Implementation Stack

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.
